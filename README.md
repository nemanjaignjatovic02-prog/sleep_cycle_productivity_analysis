 Statistical analysis of the impact of sleep, coffee and screens on productivity and mood

 Description of the project

This project examines how factors such as sleep, caffeine intake, screen time and physical activity affect productivity, mood and stress levels in individuals.
The analysis was performed using real (or simulated) data from the sleep_cycle_productivity.csv file.

 Goal 
• Determine the relationship between sleep habits and work productivity 
• Examine the effects of caffeine and screens on mood and stress 
• Apply parametric and non-parametric statistical tests 
• Show results through graphic visualizations (box plot, histogram, violin plot, contingent tables)

 Dataset

The dataset contains the following data groups: 
• Demographics: Age, Gender 
• Sleep: Sleep Start Time, Sleep End Time, Total Sleep Hours, Sleep Quality 
• Lifestyle: Exercise (mins/day), Caffeine Intake (mg), Screen Time Before Bed (mins), Work Hours (hrs/day) 
• Outcomes: Productivity Score, Mood Score, Stress Level

Total: ~8000 records, 14 columns.
Each observation represents one respondent on one day.

 Libraries used 
• pandas, numpy – data processing 
• matplotlib – visualization 
• scipy.stats – statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-square)

 Analytical sections 
1. Exploratory Analysis (EDA) – descriptive statistics and distributions 
2. Parametric tests - t-test and ANOVA 
3. Non-parametric tests - Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis 
4. Chi-square test - association of categorical variables 
5. Visualization – box plots, violin plots, contingent tables

 Results (examples) 
• More hours of sleep and better sleep quality → higher productivity score 
• Excessive screen time → higher stress level 
• Moderate caffeine intake associated with better mood
