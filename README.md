# Statistical analysis of the effects of sleep, coffee and screens on productivity and mood

## Description of the project

This project examines how factors such as sleep, caffeine intake, screen time and physical activity affect productivity, mood and stress levels in individuals.
The analysis was performed using data from the sleep_cycle_productivity.csv file.

## Goals 
• Determine the relationship between sleep habits and work productivity 

• Examine the effects of caffeine and screens on mood and stress 

• Apply parametric and non-parametric statistical tests 

• Show results through graphic visualizations (box plot, histogram, violin plot, contingent tables)

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following data groups: 
• Demographics: Age, Gender 

• Sleep: Sleep Start Time, Sleep End Time, Total Sleep Hours, Sleep Quality 

• Lifestyle: Exercise (mins/day), Caffeine Intake (mg), Screen Time Before Bed (mins), Work Hours (hrs/day) 

• Outcomes: Productivity Score, Mood Score, Stress Level

Total: about 8000 records and 14 columns.
Each observation represents one respondent on one day.

## Libraries used 
• pandas, numpy – data processing 

• matplotlib – visualization 

• scipy.stats – statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-square)

## Analytical sections 
1. Exploratory Analysis (EDA) – descriptive statistics and distributions 
2. Parametric tests - t-test and ANOVA 
3. Non-parametric tests - Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis 
4. Chi-square test - association of categorical variables 
5. Visualization – box plots, violin plots, contingent tables

## Results (examples) 
• More hours of sleep and better sleep quality are associated with higher productivity scores 

• Excessive screen time is associated with higher levels of stress 

• Moderate caffeine intake is associated with better mood
